# Arduino To Game Day 2
It's the last lab session of the semester. Here's the agenda

## Agenda
- Go over Lab Assignments Due
- Break into breakgout groups. Work on whatever you think makes sense. If you need to complete an old lab, work on this. If you want to work on the Arduino Game controller or some aspect of the documentation, work on this. If you want to work on other class work (late homework assignments, etc.) and want feedback from classmates or the TA, now's a good time for it. 
- Last 10-15 minutes, come together for review purposes. 

## Review of Assignments
### Labs Due
Labs 1 - 10 should be turned in by Monday, December 14, at 12:01 AM. I want to be able to grade anything whenver I get up. If you have questions about completing any of these labs, let me know. 

Arduino Control for your game is not a lab. It is due when your game is due (Thursday, December 17, 5PM). 
### Arduino Control for your Final Project Game
As of now, creating an Arduino Interface for your Processing Final Project Game is a source of **4** extra credit points. These extra credit points apply to lab, but will also carry over to the main class if this pushes you over the 20 points you can get in lab. 


#### To Turn In
1. A labelled diagram showing how to set up your Arduino as a controller for the game. What sensors are necessary? What ports are used? How is everything wired? In addition to the diagram, write a short explanation of how everything should be hooked up and why this sensor was a good choice. Take a picture/ set of pictures of your setup as well, focusing on how wires connect and sensors are placed. Summary:
  - labeled diagram
  - short explanation
  - picture(s)
2. A version of your Game Code using the controller. It should, at minimum, contain an explanation of how to play in the code comments. (It would also be good to have this on the main screen, but if it's not in the game you're turning in, don't worry about it. ) For example, if the game uses the joystick, what does pushing left do? Pushing right? Up? Down? pressing the button? This version of the game should use the controller to move your figure. It does not need to be optimal/ smooth motion, it just needs to work. Give a short written . Summary:
  - zip file of your arduino specific game code or github pull request 
3. Optimized game controls & Style. Your controller works and you smoothed out the motion. You made the arduino experience as seemless as possible. Write a short explanation that includes each step you took to optimize your project. If you took the time to make the user experience nicer by hiding wires and making your controller seem user friendly, add pictures / video of this setup, specifically documenting what and how you hid things. Wiring things neatly also lends itself to style. 
  - short explanation 
  - pictures/ video of nice wiring & nice, user friendly display of arduino & controller
4. Video documentation of your entire project, including a demo of someone (this can be you) / multiple people (in your social distancing bubble) trying your game using the specific controller. This video should somehow show both what is happening on screen and how your model is controlling the game with the controller. If your model/ game tester gives you feedback on the controls, feel free to add a list of comments with user feedback as a written submission. 
  - video
  - (tester feedback, if applicable)
